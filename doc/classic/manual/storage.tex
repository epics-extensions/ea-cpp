\section{``Storage'' Library} \label{sec:javaclient}
The INDEX{Storage library}, a C++ library, provides access to
local archives. It is used by the ArchiveEngine to create archives,
as well as by the ArchiveExport and Data Server programs for
retrieval.
In principle, your custom C++ code can use it as well.
Read the header files, maybe run ``doxygen'' with the provided
``ChannelArchiver.doxy'' configuration to obtain a more readable
version.

However, you also need to be aware of its shortcomings: Written
primarily to support the archiver tools, its API might change more
frequently than the network data server protocol. In addition, it is
of course limited to accessing local data files, it cannot query the
network data server.
