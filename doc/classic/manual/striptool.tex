\section{StripTool}
StripTool is primarily a Channel Access client for taking ``live''
samples from CA servers and plotting them over time.
For information on the current version, refer to the section on Host
Software: Clients under
\href{http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics}{http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics}.
A ``History'' module allows StripTool to access
data from a Channel Archiver network data server.

\NOTE This history module is incomplete. At the time, the StripTool API
did not provide means for a history data plug-in to create a configuration
GUI. There was also no support for asynchronous data retrieval,
meaning StripTool freezes while archive data is requested.
Use of the history module is discouraged except for testing.

\noindent Fig.~ \ref{fig:striptool} shows an example of Striptool after running
for about 20 minutes. It displays those 20 minutes of live data as
well as data retrieved from an archive data server, both types of data
clearly separated by a gap of about 20 minutes where the archive was
no longer and StripTool not yet running.
There will always be a small gap as a result of the ArchiveEngine's
buffering between writes to the archive.

For configuration details, refer to the file README\_XMLRPC which is
part of the XML-RPC history module for StripTool.
